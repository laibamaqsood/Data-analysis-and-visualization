 Data Analysis and Visualization in Bioinformatics

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis, statistical exploration, and visualization of biological datasets.  
The goal is to transform raw data into interpretable biological insights using modern analytical and visualization techniques.


 Project Overview

Data analysis is an essential part of computational biology. This project demonstrates how to:
- Clean, filter, and preprocess biological data (gene expression, miRNA, protein interaction data, etc.)
- Generate publication-quality plots and visualizations

- Data import and preprocessing (CSV, TSV, Excel)

- Interactive and static visualizations (e.g., scatterplots, boxplots, heatmaps, networks)
- Export-ready figures for research manuscripts
